# App Details

Build This wonderful Job serach app using React-Native. I have fetched API provided by RapidAPI, to showcase job opportunities in INDIA. 
I have also implemented search functionality to make it easier for user to search the job according to the role he/she wants.
User will also get the job details and if user is eligible and satisfied by the job opportunity , he can apply and then user will be sent
to the actual job opportunity page , where user can proceed further for next application process.
